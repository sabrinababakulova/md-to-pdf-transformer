snowball device

used for data migration

use snowball if:
- limited connectivity
- limited bandwidth
- high network cost
- shared bandwidth (can't maximize the line)
- connection stability
AWS Snowball: offline devices to perform data migrations
(if it takes more than a week to transfer over the network, use snowball device)

<h2>Edge computing</h2>
process data while it's being created on an edge location
- a truck on the road, ship on the sea, a mining station underground

these locations may have limited internet and no access to computing power
we setup a snowball edge device to do edge computing
- snowball edge compute optimized (dedicated for that use case) & storage optimized
- run ec2 instances or lambda functions at the edge
use case: preprocess data, machine learning, transcoding media


**snowball into glacier**
snowball cannot import to glacier directly
u must use s3 first, in combination with s3 lifecycle policy
