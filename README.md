# My own version of md to pdf transformer

Most of the transformers do not take into account the title of the .md files, thus i decided to create my own.
Unfortunately this particular transformer will not be taking into account many things, but only those which i use personally.
those include not many things, i don't use .md files on a daily basis, but i'll try to add as many as i can.

# Very badly optimized code

because i don't know golang actually, this is my first actual project in golang, so i'm sorry if the code is very badly optimized.

currently the code is in development
